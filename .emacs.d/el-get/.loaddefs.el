(autoload 'anything "anything" "\
Main function to execute anything sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect :buffer :keymap :default :history
Extra keywords are supported and can be added, see below.

When call interactively with no arguments deprecated `anything-sources'
will be used if non--nil.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history).

Basic keywords are the following:

:sources

Temporary value of `anything-sources'.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of an anything source.  It
also accepts an alist representing an anything source, which is
detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES)

:input

Temporary value of `anything-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `anything'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `anything' cannot be resumed.

:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.
Note that it is not working with delayed sources.

:buffer

`anything-buffer' instead of *anything*.

:keymap

`anything-map' for current `anything' session.

:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
When nil of not present `thing-at-point' will be used instead.

:history

By default all minibuffer input is pushed to `minibuffer-history',
if an argument HISTORY is provided, input will be pushed to HISTORY.
History element should be a symbol.

Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

\(anything :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
           :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
           :history history)
\(anything sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history)

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this anything session.
The `anything-' prefix can be omitted.  For example,

\(anything :sources 'anything-c-source-buffers
           :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

means starting anything session with `anything-c-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set variable `anything-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as session local variable.

\(fn &rest PLIST)" t nil)
